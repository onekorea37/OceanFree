            <p>Ocean free is a web-based video game designed to raise awareness about the importance of keeping our oceans clean and free from pollution.</p>
    
            <p>In this game, your task is to prevent trash from reaching the bottom of the ocean by clicking on it as soon as it appears. The more trash you click, the more points you earn, and the cleaner the ocean becomes. </p>
    
            <p>But be careful, some trash items are faster and trickier than others. As you progress through the game, the level of difficulty increases, and you will encounter different types of trash, such as plastic bottles, fishing nets, and even toxic waste.</p>
    
            <p>The game is designed to educate players about the ecological crises that are happening around the world and how your actions can make a difference in protecting the environment. By highlighting the importance of keeping our oceans clean, the game aims to inspire players to take action and make changes in their own lives.</p>
    
            <p>Can you save the ocean from trash? Start playing "Ocean Free" today and see how many points you can score while learning about the importance of environmental conservation.</p>
